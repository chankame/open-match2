Open Match is an open source game matchmaking framework that simplifies building
a scalable and extensible Matchmaker. It is designed to give the game developer
full control over how to make matches while removing the burden of dealing with
the challenges of running a production service at scale.

This is the public preview of the proposed second version of Open Match. Documentation will be added to the project over time.
